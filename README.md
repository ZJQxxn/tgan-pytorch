# Experiment Setup

Experiment design for reference. 


### Baselines:

**teporal** GAN (this work)

**scGAN** (https://github.com/imsb-uke/scGAN): GAN-based simulator

**Spaltter** (https://github.com/Oshlack/splatter): Bayesian-based simulator

--------

### Synthetci Data:

To mimic existing time-series sc-RNAseq data, we generate a synthetic dataset with 
**10 time steps, 1000 cells, and 1000 genes**.
